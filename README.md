This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze food consumption patterns, predict potential food wastage, and provide data-driven recommendations to reduce waste at household or commercial levels.
The goal is to build an intelligent system that helps organizations optimize inventory, reduce costs, and promote sustainability.

📌 Project Overview

Food waste is a major global problem, leading to unnecessary expenses and environmental harm.
This project uses machine learning to:

Predict the probability of food waste

Identify high-waste food categories

Analyze consumption trends

Generate actionable insights to reduce waste

The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and ML model development, all implemented in the uploaded Jupyter Notebook.

🧠 Key Objectives

Understand patterns in food consumption and wastage

Build ML models for waste prediction

Reduce waste through actionable insights

Provide data visualization to support decision-making
